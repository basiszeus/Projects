the DH Vision ISU in the replay oh yeah maybe I can let's check it out thank you for the support GL kilo let's let's see if we can see it yeah yeah yeah that one guy from the beginning of the match said in chat painful to watch it is always someone painful to watch I swear you win every game with bid Lord okay so what what he was saying isie doie here's to four more years gr thanks very much peee what he's saying is uncle reincarnation got buffed to revive in 5 seconds instead of seven this didn't make any change for any hero in the game but for Demon Hunter he suspects it's because Demon Hunter is one of the slowest death animations in the game he dies and then he goes and he basically commits suu and he thinks because of that for some reason the ank of reincarnation Vision imprints on the demon hun instead of him having 800800 Vision he has 200 Vision which is what an has you'll see the an Vision soon our so this is demon under Vision this is ank it's not 200 it's like 275 or 300 our Warriors have wow that's why you walked into us like that I'm blind not deaf ah I missed the blind not deaf joke just listen to the footsteps you've got that fell spectral side out nice
